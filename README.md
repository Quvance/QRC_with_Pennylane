## Motivation

The aim of this project is to *create a self-contained tutorial or demonstration of an idea from quantum computing* (see Paragraph "What hackathon project should my team do?" - [QHack2023/README.md at main Â· XanaduAI/QHack2023 (github.com)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/QHack2023/blob/main/README.md)).

### Disclaimer

This is a first introduction to the topic of *Quantum Reservoir Computing with Pennylane* and it will be followed by use case applications in subsequent developments.

## Abstract

Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) is the combination of quantum computing and physical reservoir computing to harness complex quantum dynamics as a reservoir for real-time machine learning tasks [1]. The approach followed by QRC is to exploit the complexity of natural (disordered) quantum dynamics for information processing. The framework of QRC enables to universally emulate nonlinear dynamical systems including classical chaos.
